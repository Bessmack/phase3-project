Troubleshooting
If you encounter circular import errors:

Make sure all imports follow the pattern established in the refactored code

Check that you're not importing between ui.py and game.py directly

Use the dedicated scoreboard.py module for score-related functionality

Customization
You can modify various game aspects by editing the constants in modules/utils.py:

Game dimensions

Player speed

Enemy spawn rates

Difficulty settings

Visual elements
